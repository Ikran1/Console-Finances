# Console-Finances

Creating JS code for analysing the financial records of a company

## Description

In this challenge, I analysed the financial records for a company, using my JavaScript knowledge in arrays, for loops and conditional statements. This has allowed me to solidify my understanding of these concepts and apply it to solve real-world situations.
